# Task Tracker

A basic full-stack productivity app built with React and Node.js (in progress).  
Currently part of my journey into full-stack development.

## Features (Planned):
- Add / edit / delete tasks
- Mark tasks complete
- Store tasks in backend (MongoDB or in-memory for MVP)
- Responsive UI

## Stack:
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- DB: MongoDB (or in-memory fallback)

## Status:
Initial setup underway. Backend routes and UI in progress.
